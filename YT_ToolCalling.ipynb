Would definitely recommend this place for one or two people visiting Chicago!\",\\n      \"Great value for the price, just steps away from the blue line train. Host is very communicative and made sure we had everything we needed. <br\\\\/>Note- I think this was meant to be the wheelchair accessible unit (it was on the first floor and had a flat shower entry and a shower chair and helpful support bars in the bathroom). We noticed that if this was to be an accessible unit, the shower head probably needed to be detachable and the silverware and other kitchen utensils would need to be placed in a lower cabinet. If you\\\\u2019re a wheelchair user who intends to use the kitchen, maybe ask that the host move the kitchen utensils out of the upper cabinets before you arrive. Also, the washer\\\\/dryer is a stacked so the dryer on top might be hard to reach.<br\\\\/>Again, we had a really great stay and will absolutely book here again when we return to Chicago.
